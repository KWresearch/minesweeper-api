# minesweeper-api

Like minesweeper, but as an HTTP API.

Checkout the [documentation](http://enrmarc.github.io/minesweeper-api/).
Checkout a [simple command line node client](https://github.com/enrmarc/minesweeper-node-client).

Install and run:

    bundle install && ./launch

The app is [deployed on a free tier of Heroku](https://minesapi.herokuapp.com/game),
so be aware that sometimes it won't be available (to be precise, the app will be off
6h/day).
